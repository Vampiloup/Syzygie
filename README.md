Strategy game in space like Master of Orion II &amp; Co. And bunnies.

Made with Defold https://defold.com/, and coded with LUA

That's an old pet project from me, from the time I wanted to mod Master of Orion II. I'm trying to do a little every day or so.

#### Licence :
Apache 2.0
I'm all for open-source and free-software, and if people can't reuse it even commercialy it's not free software for me. After all, "it's not a lot, but it's honest job)".

#### For now :

Actually : Can generate a "galaxie". Star systems have positionned on map with failsafe about stars too near of each other (64 pixels, a star sprite being 32x32). Have orbital stuff, humidity levels, temps and zones on planets.
Visually, show a map of the map in the camera pow (basically 1920*1080, the default map - medium size - being 2000x2000), with stars in good coordinates and colors.

#### Short plan :

Recreating the vibes of those old sci-fi games : Mysterious infinite reaches of space. It's an hommage to MoO II, Imperium Galactica or Ascendancy, with of course my own feeling (I like to play slowly) and trying to correct the "micro" that plagued the endgames.
